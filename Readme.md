## 🧠 AI Features (via Gemini API)

  

1.  **Rule Generation from Natural Language**

Converts human-friendly prompts like _"people who haven’t shopped in 6 months and spent over ₹5K"_ into logical audience segmentation rules.

  

2.  **Message Suggestions**

AI generates 2–3 message variants based on a campaign objective like _"bring back inactive users"_.

  

3.  **Delivery Performance Summaries**

Transforms raw stats into human-readable summaries, e.g.,

_"Your campaign reached 1,284 users. 1,140 messages were delivered. Customers with > ₹10K spend had a 95% delivery rate."_

  

4.  **Campaign Label Generation**

AI auto-tags campaigns as _“Win-back”_, _“High Value Customers”_, etc., based on message and audience context.

  

💡 **Why Gemini AI?**

Gemini APIs enabled intelligent text analysis and content generation, dramatically improving CRM usability and automation without manual rule setup or content writing.

### Module Overview

  

-  `frontend/`: React-based UI with rule builder, campaign dashboard, and OAuth.

-  `backend/`: API server for auth, ingestion, campaign management. Integrated with Kafka and MongoDB.

-  `brokers/`: Docker-based Kafka setup for local development.

-  `consumers/`:

-  `campaign-delivery-consumer`: Sends messages via vendor.

-  `data-ingestion-consumer`: Stores customer/order data.

-  `delivery-receipt-consumer`: Updates delivery logs asynchronously.

-  `vendor-backend/`: Mocks vendor behavior (~90% success, ~10% failure).

-  `healthcheck/`: Keeps services warm using cron pings (free tier hosting workaround).

## 🔐 Authentication

  

- Uses **Google OAuth 2.0** for secure login.

- All protected routes (audience creation, campaign view) require authentication.

## 📬 Campaign Workflow Summary

  

1.  **Audience Segment Creation**:

- Dynamic rule builder supports nested AND/OR logic.

- Optionally uses AI prompt for rule generation.

- Shows preview audience size before saving.

  

2.  **Campaign Creation**:

- Triggers Kafka event.

- Stored in communication log by a consumer.

  

3.  **Message Delivery**:

-  `campaign-delivery-consumer` sends messages via vendor API.

- Vendor randomly succeeds/fails (~90/10 split).

- Hits delivery receipt API.

  

4.  **Delivery Receipt**:

- Handled asynchronously in batch.

- Statuses updated in MongoDB by `delivery-receipt-consumer`.

  

5.  **Campaign History Page**:

- Displays campaign list with delivery stats.

- AI-powered performance summaries and labels included.

## 🧪 Local Setup

  

### Prerequisites

  

- Node.js v18+

- Docker (for Kafka)

- MongoDB running locally or on Atlas

  

### Steps

  

```bash

# 1. Clone the repo

git  clone  https://github.com/Gzie3009/XENO-CRM.git

cd  XENO-CRM

  

# 2. Start Kafka (locally)

cd  brokers/kafka-cluster

docker-compose  up  -d

  

# 3. Start backend services

cd  backend/

npm  install && node  index.js

  

# (Repeat for each consumer)

cd  ../consumers/campaign-delivery-consumer/

npm  install && node  index.js

  

cd  ../data-ingestion-consumer/

npm  install && node  index.js

  

cd  ../delivery-receipt-consumer/

npm  install && node  index.js

  

# 4. Start frontend

cd  ../../frontend

npm  install

npm  run  dev

  

# 5. Start vendor mock server

cd  ../vendor-backend

npm  install && node  index.js

  

# 6. Replace the env.example with .env file

  

# 7. (Optional) Start healthcheck ping server- for use in production only , change the URLs first

cd  ../healthcheck

npm  install && node  index.js
```
  
  
  
  
  
  

### 📊  Seeding  the  API  for  Testing  Scalability

To  simulate  a  realistic  workload  and  test  the  scalability  of  the  customer  and  order  ingestion  APIs,  a  set  of  seed  scripts  are  provided  inside  the  backend/seed  folder.

  

📂  Seed  Scripts

seedCustomer.js

seedOrders.js

seedCustomersViaApi.js 

seedOrdersViaApi.js

To run seed scripts:
```bash
node [filename].js
```
  

🛠️  Usage

These  scripts  allow  you  to  insert  sample  customer  and  order  data  either  directly  via  the  database  or  through  the  API  endpoints.

  

Useful  for  testing  performance,  batch  ingestion,  and  Kafka  message  flow.

  

Before  running,  make  sure  to:

  

Update  the  .env  variables  wherever  required (e.g., DB  URI,  API  URLs).

  

Have  all  services (backend, Kafka,  consumers) running.

  

📌  Notes

The  *ViaApi.js  scripts  hit  the  actual  ingestion  APIs  to  simulate  real-world  usage.

  

You  can  adjust  the  dataset  size  or  loop  count  inside  the  scripts  to  scale  up  load  testing.
